# BatchRecursiveConvertWPS2PDF
 This script recursively scans a folder and its subdirectories for .wps (Microsoft Works Document) files and converts them into .pdf using LibreOffice (soffice). The script keeps the original folder structure intact, saving each converted PDF in the same directory as the corresponding WPS file.
